  abstract = {We lay a comprehensive foundation for the study of redundant information
	storage in decoherence processes. Redundancy has been proposed as
	a prerequisite for objectivity, the defining property of classical
	objects. We consider two ensembles of states for a model universe
	consisting of one system and many environments: the first consisting
	of arbitrary states, and the second consisting of ``singly-branching''
	states consistent with a simple decoherence model. Typical states
	from the random ensemble do not store information about the system
	redundantly, but information stored in branching states has a redundancy
	proportional to the environment's size. We compute the specific redundancy
	for a wide range of model universes, and fit the results to a simple
	first-principles theory. Our results show that the presence of redundancy
	divides information about the system into three parts: classical
	(redundant); purely quantum; and the borderline, undifferentiated
	or ``nonredundant,'' information.},

	we show that in this model (introduced some time ago to illustrate

	coupling strengths can lead to a universal (Gaussian) suppression
	of coherence between pointer states. On the other hand, we show that
	when the dynamics of the central spin is dominant a different regime
	emerges, which is characterized by a non--Gaussian decay and a dramatically
	different set of pointer states. We explore the regimes of validity
	of the Gaussian--decay and discuss its relation to the spectral features

  abstract = {I show how probabilities arise in quantum physics by exploring implications
	of {\it environment - assisted invariance} or {\it envariance}, a
	recently discovered symmetry exhibited by entangled quantum systems.
	Envariance of perfectly entangled ``Bell-like'' states can be used
	to rigorously justify complete ignorance of the observer about the
	outcome of any measurement on either of the members of the entangled
	pair. For more general states, envariance leads to Born's rule, $p_k
	\propto |\psi_k|^2$ for the outcomes associated with Schmidt states.
	Probabilities derived in this manner are an objective reflection
	of the underlying state of the system -- they represent experimentally
	verifiable symmetries, and not just a subjective ``state of knowledge''
	of the observer. Envariance - based approach is compared with and
	found superior to pre-quantum definitions of probability including
	the {\it standard definition} based on the `principle of indifference'
	due to Laplace, and the {\it relative frequency approach} advocated
	by von Mises. Implications of envariance for the interpretation of
	quantum theory go beyond the derivation of Born's rule: Envariance
	is enough to establish dynamical independence of preferred branches
	of the evolving state vector of the composite system, and, thus,
	to arrive at the {\it environment - induced superselection (einselection)
	of pointer states}, that was usually derived by an appeal to decoherence.
	Envariant origin of Born's rule for probabilities sheds a new light
	on the relation between ignorance (and hence, information) and the
	nature of quantum states.},

	the emergence of the classical from the quantum substrate are described.
	The stability of correlations between the einselected quantum pointer
	states and the environment allows them to exist almost as objectively
	as classical states were once thought to exist: There are ways of
	finding out what is the pointer state of the system which utilize
	redundancy of their correlations with the environment, and which
	leave einselected states essentially unperturbed. This relatively
	objective existence of certain quantum states facilitates operational
	definition of probabilities in the quantum setting. Moreover, once
	there are states that `exist' and can be `found out', a `collapse'
	in the traditional sense is no longer necessary --- in effect, it
	has already happened. The records of the observer will contain evidence
	of an effective collapse. The role of the preferred states in the
	processing and storage of information is emphasized. The existential
	interpretation based on the relatively objective existence of stable
	correlations between the einselected states of observers memory and
